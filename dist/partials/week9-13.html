Sometimes she's pushing herself to eat but knows it will eventually make her feel better and give her more energy. She's starting to snack more on crackers, cereal bars and even some fruit. Our friends Jennifer and Stephen recently bought their own apartment.</p><p>We decided that their <b>house warming would be the perfect time to tell all our friends</b> as we'll all be under the one roof. Jennifer and Stephen were the first to know our news, we told them just a week after we found out. <b>We were so excited to make the announcement</b> but also worried someone would notice laura pouring her alcohol free Kopperberg and let the cat out of the bag.</p></div></div><!--close-main-content--><div class="overflow-container orange"><div class="main-content"><section class="flex flex-center wrap"><div class="col-50"><h2>Daisee love</h2><p>Selina couldn't get a baby sitter for little Daisee so brought her to the house warming.

We even seen baby’s teeny tiny fingers! The scan was slightly jumpy at times, simply because <b>mammy was crying with happiness</b>. We got pictures of the scan and as soon as we left, we told more of our family and friends our news and sent on pictures of the little baby.</p></div><div class="post-image"><img image-swap image-src1="img/week9-13/week-11-scan.jpg" image-src2="img/week9-13/week-11-scan-pressed.jpg" src="img/week9-13/week-11-scan.jpg" alt=""> <span class="press-me"><h2>press Me</h2></span></div></div>

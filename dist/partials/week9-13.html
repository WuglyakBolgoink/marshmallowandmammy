Sometimes she's pushing herself to eat because she knows it will make her feel a little better. She's starting to snack more on crackers, cereal bars and even some fruit. Our friends Jennifer and Stephen recently bought their own apartment.</p><p>We decided that <b>the house warming would be the perfect time to tell all our friends</b> as we're all under the one roof. Jennifer and Stephen were the first of our friends to know, we told them just a week after we found out. We were so excited to make the announcement but also worried someone would notice laura pouring her alcohol free Kopperberg and let the cat out of the bag.</p></div></div><!--close-main-content--><div class="overflow-container orange"><div class="main-content"><section class="flex flex-center wrap"><div class="col-50"><h2>Daisee love</h2><p>Selina couldn't get a baby sitter for little Daisee so brought her to the house warming.

Days later, we heard the amazing news that our friends <b>Andy and Orla had gotten engaged!</b> They are both making a big move to Abu Dhabi for a couple of years, with Orla traveling over first and Andy following a couple of months later. With perfect timing, Andy popped the question!</p><p>An engagement party was of course had, this being <b>Laura’s first night out not drinking</b>. She handled it very well, heading home early because of tiredness. I decided to stay out and carry on the celebrations for both of us…something I may or may not have regretted it the next <strike>morning</strike> evening, waking up to a stone cold 12 inch subway crushed into the carpet.</p><div class="divider-container"><hr class="divider"><span class="divider-title"><h2>Week 11</h2></span></div><div class="text-section section-spacing"><h2>Marshmallow, we love you already!</h2><span class="underline-center"></span><p><b>We finally had our first scan</b>.

We even seen baby’s teeny tiny fingers! The scan was slightly jumpy at times, simply because <b>mammy was crying with happiness</b>. We got pictures of the scan and as soon as we left, we told more of our family and friends our news and sent on pictures of the little baby.</p></div><div class="post-image"><img lazy-load image-swap image-src1="img/week9-13/week-11-scan.jpg" image-src2="img/week9-13/week-11-scan-pressed.jpg" src="img/spinner.gif" data-original="img/week9-13/week-11-scan.jpg" alt=""> <span class="press-me"><h2>press Me</h2></span></div><div class="divider-container"><hr class="divider"><span class="divider-title"><h2>Week 12</h2></span></div><div style="padding-bottom: 0px!important" class="text-section section-spacing"><img class="fb-like-img" lazy-load src="img/spinner.gif" data-original="img/week9-13/facebook-like.jpg" alt=""><h2>Happy Anniversary!</h2><span class="underline-center"></span><p>The twelve week mark happened to fall on the week of <b>our 2 year anniversary</b>, both certainly a reason to celebrate. We decided to book a night in Fitzpatrick Castle out in Killiney, a place we had stayed when we were only together three months. Little did we know we would be back two years later and expecting a baby! The hotel was great. <b>We went swimming and had a gorgeous steak dinner</b>. Laura even had a glass of red wine with dinner and somehow made it last for two hours! <b>We made our pregnancy Facebook offical</b>, because ya' know, if it's not on Facebook it probably didn't happen. Laura had a "Mama Bird" t-shirt printed for the occasion. The response we received about our news was overwhelming. <b>Everyone was full of happiness and well wishes for us</b>.</p></div></div><div class="main-content"><div class="divider-container"><hr class="divider"><span class="divider-title"><h2>Week 13</h2></span></div></div><div style="margin-top: 0!important" class="overflow-container orange"><div class="main-content"><section class="flex flex-center wrap"><div class="col-50"><h2>Baby's first outfit</h2><p>This week has been amazing! <b>Laura’s appetite is getting better</b> and better and she’s started to notice her jeans becoming slightly tighter, as was her swimsuit last week.

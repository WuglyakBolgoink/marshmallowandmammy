We're struggling to think of boys names we can agree on and have about 4 girls names we love.</p><p><b>We're having a boy!!!</b> Marshmallow is doing great and measuring perfectly. We both thought it may be a girl so the shock and surprise of finding out it‚Äôs a little boy was amazing! The doctor turned on the 3D scan for a couple of minutes and <b>baby had his fists up to his face like a boxer..that‚Äôs my boy!!</b></p></div><div class="post-image"><img lazy-load src="img/spinner.gif" data-original="img/week18-21/its-a-boy.jpg" alt=""></div></div><!--close-main-content--><div style="margin-top: 100px!important; margin-bottom: 0px!important" class="overflow-container pink"><div class="main-content"><section class="flex flex-center wrap"><div class="col-50"><h2>Mammy's Birthday</h2><p>This week was Laura‚Äôs birthday so I decided to surprise her with a night away in Cork and a trip to Fota Wildlife Park as it‚Äôs somewhere she‚Äôs always wanted to go. I packed us a picnic for the day and off we went. She was so surprised and delighted when she saw where we were going. We had a great day and went for a swim and then dinner in the hotel later that night.</p><p>Laura also got a huge surprise when her sister Sandra flew home from England a couple days later to spend her birthday with her. We all had a such a lovely time celebrating Laura's Birthday and Marshmallow joined in with some little birthday kicks.</p></div><div class="col-50 flex img-flex-end with-caption"><img lazy-load class="image-right first-outfit" src="img/spinner.gif" data-original="img/week18-21/wk-19-bibs.png" alt=""><p><i>Above: We picked up some things for our boy</i></p></div></section></div></div><div class="photo-grid-container flex wrap"><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-1"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">Flowers for the the birthday girl!</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-2"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">The 3 of us going to dinner</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-3"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">Fishies!</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-4"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">Is there anybody out there?</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-5"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">Fota Wildlife</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-6"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">The Unsinkable Ship...</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-7"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">Mammy!</h2></span></div><div class="photo-grid-item photo-grid-item-8"><span class="grid-desc"><h2 class="flex flex-center">ickle Penguin</h2></span></div></div><div style="margin-top: 100px" class="main-content"><div class="week-status"><h2>Marshmallow's Measurements</h2><img lazy-load src="img/spinner.gif" data-original="img/week18-21/week20-status.png" alt="Week 20 development"><p>Marshmallow's weighs about 10 1/2 ounces now. He's also around 6 1/2 inches long from head to bottom and about 10 inches from head to heel. Marshmallow is swallowing more these days, which is good practice for his digestive system. He's also producing meconium, a black, sticky by-product of digestion, which we'll see in his first nappy.</p></div></div>

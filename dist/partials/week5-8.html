<div class="header-container blue"><header><h1>Week 5-8</h1><h4>First Trimester</h4></header><div class="header-intro"><h2>Tummy Bubbles & Toilet trips!</h2><p>If you haven't guessed... we're having a baby! We found out at roughly 5 and a half weeks and Laura went straight to the doctor to confirm everything was ok. By the sixth week, she was feeling ‘bubbles’ in her tummy, her body getting ready for the big changes ahead! Although still early on, Laura was already having to go to the bathroom much more… the joys of pregnancy. We of course told our parents and siblings and all are delighted for us, some even cried with happiness!</p></div></div><div class="main-content"><div class="image-100 caption week-info" data-week="week 6" data-caption="No bump...Just Pizza!"><img src="/img/week5-8/img/bump.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="no bump, just pizza"></div><div class="tri-circle-img"><img src="img/week5-8/img/tri-circle.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt=""></div><div class="text-section"><h2>Beach day, amusements and our first measurements.</h2><span class="underline-center"></span><p>To celebrate our good news, we took a day trip out to Bray. We stuffed our faces with ice cream went to Sea Life which was amazing and spent all our money in the amusements. With the tokens earned from the slots we had enough to get a pack of loom bands, toy soldiers, a yoyo or a Star Wars savings tin. We chose the savings tin. It seemed appropriate for the future ahead although a yoyo would have been sweet too!</p><p>That evening, I took the first photo of Laura and her non-existent pregnant tummy. I also got some measurements to keep a record of how big she will get over the next few months. All in all it was a beautiful day and marshmallow was the best company. We're excited and apprehensive for the future.</p></div><!-- WEEK 7 --><div class="divider-container"><hr class="divider"><span class="divider-title"><h2>Week 7 <span style="font-size: 30px">&</span> 8</h2></span></div><div class="week-7"><div class="post-image"><img image-swap image-src1="img/week5-8/img/healthy-shopping.jpg" image-src2="img/week5-8/img/healthy-shopping-hover.jpg" src="img/week5-8/img/healthy-shopping.jpg" alt=""> <span class="press-me"><h2>press Me</h2></span></div></div><section class="flex flex-center wrap"><div class="col-50"><h2>Switching up the diet</h2><span class="underline"></span><p>Laura is anaemic, which means she is naturally low in iron. Laura is actively trying to eat more ‘healthy goodness’ for the baby and to try increase her iron levels too. We did a big shop for things such as fruit, veg, healthy snacks and smoothie making ingredients. This was our fool proof way to get as much goodness as possible for the baby.</p></div><div class="col-50 flex img-flex-end"><img class="circle-image-right" src="img/week5-8/img/smoothie-circle.png" alt=""></div></section></div><!--close-main-content--><div class="overflow-container blue"><div class="main-content"><h1>That didn't last long...</h1><p>The healthy business did not go as planned. Laura managed a couple of good days but unfortunately became unwell with a severe case of tonsillitis. She went off almost all food, only managing things like dry toast, rice cakes and little plain pancakes. Basically nothing but carbs. Exhaustion also hit hard this week with daily naps and Laura barely being able to move off the couch... unless to go to the bathroom!</p></div></div><div class="main-content"><div class="week-status"><h1>Marshmallow's Measurements</h1><img src="img/week5-8/img/week-8-status-img.png" alt=""><p>Marshmallow is the size of a small lego brick.
